# Emergent In-Context Learning in Transformers

This is the codebase associated with the following paper:

**Data Distributional Properties Drive Emergent In-Context Learning in
Transformers** ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05055))<br/>
_Stephanie C.Y. Chan, Adam Santoro, Andrew K. Lampinen, Jane X. Wang, Aaditya
Singh, Pierre H. Richemond, Jay McClelland, Felix Hill_

The experiments involve training and evaluating a transformer on sequences of
[Omniglot](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot) image-label pairs, to elicit
and measure (few-shot) in-context learning vs in-weights learning. See Sec 2 of
the paper for an overview of the experimental design.
